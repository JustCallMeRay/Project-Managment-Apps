Mobile app 
	 	The mobile site is currently eaiser to use and has more features than the app.
	When not connected changes should be "cached" and changed when connection returns, if two changes were made; handle accoringly. 
	Should allow edits of files easily (at least) Files are easily veiwable but not (as far as I can tell) editable. 
	View projects, (like the mobile site.)
	
Projects:
	Projects should allow for a gant chart. Gant chart is a must, I will not back down. 
	Project templates should be left blank after using them for the first time, if a tutorial is required have it in a pop-up and skippable. Current templates take longer to set up than a blank project
	Allow for certain cards to be tagged/ labled (not a big deal as github allows unlimited boards) 
	Allow for cards to contain projects or have a "master" board with all cards from other boards.
Other:
	Allow me to set a default indention method and add a "notes" language so I can use autocorrect (maybe even markdown) (shown .note in this file)
	When in a repsotory and I click on my own name (in blue at the top) bring me to my repositories not my profile page.
