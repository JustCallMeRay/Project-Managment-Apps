The webpage is a defult bright white with no lines, borders shpwing where I can click. This makes navigation almost impossible. 
There was no imdediate dark mode (after being blinded for the entire tutorial) so I quit before I got a migrane 
	A dark mode extenstion is not a soultion. The problem would be less bad if there was any colour darker than the sun (see default github)

Cannot sign in with google imediatly on the mobile app. I cannot sign in at all (due to 2FA) and must be done without dark mode. 

I have never seen such low quality of life from any site, the UI designers and accessibility team should be ashamed.

	Edit: Github's default is a off white with with two darked bars at the top and borders around all (non user) text.
