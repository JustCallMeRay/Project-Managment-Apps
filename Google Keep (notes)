Mobile app
	Amazing! Has dark mode, live updates, caches changes untill connection returns, does everything the desktop version can do almost as easily.
	
Everything else:
	No "To Do" automation
	Only one indention with tick boxes
	No easy indentaiton method (tab moves to close note)
	Note does not take up full screen on desktop.
	Note preview shows full note on desktop (WHY? It really isn't difficult to click on a note)
	No gant chart ( D: ) 
	No priorites on tick boxes.
	No easy organisational strat (Lables are okay but not perfect, allow for more complex filtering and a "Default label" folder method prefered)


Keep notes are really good but it becomes difficult to read and I feel like I need a new gmail acount to keep the notes in for my project,
something I am okay with but cannot tie to a phone number so would be scared of losing. Also most of it's benefits are basic things I would want others
to implement.
